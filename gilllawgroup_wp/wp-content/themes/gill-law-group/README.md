This is a fork from Todd Motto's HTML5 Blank theme:

* Project: [github.com/toddmotto/html5blank](https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank)
* Website: [html5blank.com](http://html5blank.com)
* Twitter: [@html5blank](http://twitter.com/html5blank)
* Author : [Todd Motto](http://toddmotto.com) // [@toddmotto](http://twitter.com/toddmotto)

# Dependencies
If you do not already, you may need the following installed on your computer:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower)
* [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-install)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

However, I used [Codekit](https://codekitapp.com) when developing this site and it does much of what the above packages offer. Codekit will compile every coding language, refresh browsers automatically as you work, optimize images, and more.

# QuickStart

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to your project folder within the Terminal.
3. Drag project folder into Codekit and adjust any settings if necessary.
